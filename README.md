# palindrome

FreeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures\
Certification Project - Build a palindrome checker\

Some of the *many* challenges I faced  making this were:

* Learning where to add EventListeners in the code.
* Using basic regex for the first time in a project.
* Using arrow functions.<br><br>

* Adding extra containers to make flexbox work as I wanted.
* Learning to style `<details>`.<br><br>

I was determined to make the original input appear bold in\
the result, as in the FreeCodeCamp example. I think this\
actually took the most time to manage within the project's\
constraints (the entire output had to be within the #results).\
The solution I ultimately found is depreciated.
